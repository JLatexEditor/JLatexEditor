<h2>\&lt;space&gt;</h2>



<p>LaTeX normally leaves a little extra space after sentences.

However, it uses a rather simple rule for determining whether a

period ends a sentence: it assumes that periods end sentences

<em>unless</em> they follow an upper case letter. To let LaTeX

know that a period does <em>not</em> end a sentence after, for

example, an abbreviation, use <tt>\&lt;space&gt;</tt></p>



<p>For example,</p>



<pre>

    Jones, et al.\ (1993) ...

</pre>



<p>Such a space may also be needed after a text-producing

command, such as one defined with

<tt><a href="ltx-18.html">\newcommand</a></tt>. As an example,

consider</p>



<pre>

    \newcommand{\water}{H$_2$O}

    \water, \water\ everywhere, but not a drop ...

</pre>



<p>The first <tt>\water</tt> command is terminated by the comma;

note that LaTeX does not leave a space between the first

<tt>\water</tt> and the comma -- as desired -- and the trailing

space is treated as an interword space.  However, the second

<tt>\water</tt> command is terminated by the space, but LaTeX 

would not leave an extra space after this, running

"H<sub>2</sub>Owater" into one word, except for  the trailing

<tt>\ </tt>.</p>



<p>An alternate way to indicate the end of a command so that a

trailing space is interpreted as an interword space is to use

braces:</p>



<pre>

    \water, \water{} everywhere, ...

</pre>
