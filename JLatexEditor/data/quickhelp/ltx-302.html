<h2>\raisebox</h2>



<p><tt>\raisebox{distance}[extend-above][extend-below]{text}</tt></p>



<p>The <tt>\raisebox</tt> command creates a LR box containing

<tt>text</tt>; it is used to raise or lower text. The first

mandatory argument specifies how high the text is to be raised

(or lowered if it is a negative amount).</p>



<p>Sometimes it's useful to make LaTeX think something has a

different size than it really does - or a different size than

LaTeX would normally think it has. The <tt>\raisebox</tt>

command lets you tell LaTeX how tall it is.</p>



<p>The first optional argument, <tt>extend-above</tt>, makes

LaTeX think that the text extends above the current line by the

amount specified. The second optional argument,

<tt>extend-below</tt>, makes LaTeX think that the text extends

below the current line by the amount specified.</p>



<p><tt>\raisebox</tt> is <a href="fragile.html">fragile</a>.</p>
