<h2>Modes</h2>



<p>When LaTeX is processing your input text, it is always in one of three

modes:</p>



<ul>

  <li><i>Paragraph</i> mode</li>

  <li><i>Math</i> mode</li>

  <li><i>Left-to-right</i> mode, called LR mode for short</li>

</ul>



<p>LaTeX  changes  mode only when  it goes  up or down  a staircase  to a

different  level, though not all level changes  produce  mode changes.

Mode changes occur only when entering  or leaving  an environment,  or

when  LaTeX  is processing  the  argument  of  certain  text-producing

commands. </p>



<h3>Paragraph mode</h3>



<p>Paragraph  mode  is the most  common;  it's  the one LaTeX  is in when

processing  ordinary  text.  In that mode, LaTeX breaks your text into

lines and breaks  the lines  into pages. </p>



<p>There

are also several text-producing commands and environments for making a

box that put LaTeX  in paragraph  mode.   The box made by one of these

commands  or environments  will be called a 

<a href="ltx-294.html">parbox</a>.   When LaTeX is in

paragraph mode while making a box, it is said to be in inner paragraph

mode.  The normal  paragraph  mode, in which LaTeX starts  out, is called

outer paragraph mode.</p>



<h3>Math mode</h3> 



<p>LaTeX  is in math mode when it's generating a mathematical formula. It is

in math mode in the <a href="ltx-115.html#math">math</a>, 

<a href="ltx-421.html">displaymath</a>, <a href="ltx-224.html">equation</a>,

and <a href="ltx-223.html"> eqnarray</a> environments.</p>



<p>In math mode letters are assumed to be math symbols and spaced accordingly.

Spaces in the input are ignored, except that spaces may be needed to 

delineate the end of commands.</p>



<h3>LR mode</h3>



<p>In LR mode, as in paragraph

mode, LaTeX considers  the output that it produces  to be a string  of

words with spaces between them. In LR mode, unlike paragraph and math modes,

spaces are not ignored; an input space creates an output space. 

However, unlike paragraph mode, LaTeX

keeps going from left to right; it never starts a new line in LR mode. 

Even  if you put a hundred  words  into  an 

<tt><a href="ltx-265.html">\mbox</a></tt>,  LaTeX  would  keep

typesetting  them from left to right  inside  a single  box,  and then

complain because the resulting box was too wide to fit on the line.</p>



<p>LaTeX is in LR mode when it starts making a box with an 

<tt><a href="ltx-265.html">\mbox</a></tt> command. 

You can get it to enter a different mode inside the box - for example,

you can make it enter  math mode to put a formula  in the box.  </p>
