<h2>Comments in file</h2>


<p>You can insert comments into the LaTeX input (*.tex) file.

    Anything following a percent sign (<tt>%</tt>) until the end of

    the line is ignored by the LaTeX processor. </p>


<p>In fact, the <tt>%</tt> ends a line without generating a

    space; an end-of-line in LaTeX input is normally equivalent to a

    space. Thus, for example, it allows one to split a word over

    lines without inserting a break. For example:</p>



<pre>

    this is an extra%

    ordinarily long word

</pre>


<p>would produce "this is an extraordinarily long word" with no

    breaks. However, a <strong>command</strong> cannot be split

    over lines this way.</p>
