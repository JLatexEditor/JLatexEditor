<p>LaTeX normally leaves a little extra space after punctuation,

such as the period which ends a sentence.  However, it uses a

rather simple rule for determining whether a period ends a

sentence: it assumes that periods end sentences <em>unless</em>

they follow an upper case letter. To tell LaTeX to insert extra

space after punctuation which follows an upper case letter,

precede the punctuation by <tt>\@</tt>.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<pre>

    It is I\@.

</pre>



<p>would not be considered to be a sentence by LaTeX except for

the <tt>\@</tt>.</p>
