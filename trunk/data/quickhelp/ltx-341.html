<h2>\vector</h2>



<p><tt>\vector(x-slope,y-slope){length}</tt></p>



<p>The <tt>\vector</tt> command draws an arrow of the specified

length and slope with the arrow head at the opposite end of the

line from the reference point (see

<tt><a href="ltx-296.html">\put</a></tt>).</p>



<p>The slope is determined by <tt>(x-slope,y-slope)</tt> which

are signed integers of magnitude less than or equal to 4 and

which have no common divisor except for plus or minus one; For

example (1,0) is a horizontal arrow pointing right; (1,1) gives

a slope of 45 degress; (0,1) is a vertical arrow pointing up;

(-1,1) is at 135 degrees.</p>



<p>The <strong>horizontal</strong> extent of the arrow is given

by the <tt>length</tt> parameter, except in the case of a

vertical arrow in which case <tt>length</tt> specifies the

vertical height.</p>
