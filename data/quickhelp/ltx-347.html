<h2>\vspace</h2>


<p><tt>\vspace[*]{length}</tt></p>


<p>The <tt>\vspace</tt> command adds vertical space. The length

    of the space can be expressed in any terms that LaTeX

    understands, i.e., points, inches, etc. You can add negative as

    well as positive space with an <tt>\vspace</tt> command.</p>


<p>If <tt>\vspace</tt> appears in the middle of a paragraph the

    space is added after the line containing it.</p>


<p>LaTeX removes vertical space that comes at the end of a page.

    If you don't want LaTeX to remove this space, include the

    optional * argument. Then the space is never removed.</p>
