<h2>Dashes</h2>


<p>LaTeX provides for three sizes of dashes which are indicated

    by typing one, two, or three consecutive dashes in the text.</p>


<ul>

    <li>a hyphenation dash, as in X-ray, is a single dash</li>

    <li>a dash between limits, as in 1--2, is a double dash</li>

    <li>a parenthetical punctuation --- such as this --- is a triple dash</li>

</ul>


<p>Note that this applies to paragraph mode. In math mode each

    <tt>-</tt> is interpreted as a minus sign.</p>
