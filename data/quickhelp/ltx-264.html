<h2>\markboth \markright</h2>


<p><tt>\markboth{left head}{right head}</tt></p>


<p><tt>\markright{right head}</tt></p>


<p>The <tt>\markboth</tt> and <tt>\markright</tt> commands are

    used in conjunction with the page style myheadings for

    setting either both or just the right heading. In addition

    to their use with the myheadings page style, you can use them to

    override the normal headings in the headings style, since

    LaTeX uses these same commands to generate those heads. You

    should note that a left-hand heading is generated by the

    last <tt>\markboth</tt> command before the end of the page,

    while a right-hand heading is generated by the first

    <tt>\markboth</tt> or <tt>\markright</tt> that comes on the

    page if there is one, otherwise by the last one before the

    page.</p>
