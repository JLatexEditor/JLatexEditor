<h2>Quotation Marks</h2>


<p>LaTeX distinguishes between left (<tt>`</tt>) and right

    (<tt>'</tt>) quotation marks; the former corresponds to the

    "grave" generally found to the left of the numbers at top of the

    keyboard, and the latter corresponds to the usual single quote

    mark.</p>


<p>These symbols, by themselves, produce left and right single

    quotes.</p>


<p>Double quote are produced by typing two in a row:

    <tt>``text''</tt>.</p>


<p>To separate consecutive single and double quotes, use a

    <tt><a href="ltx-185.html">\,</a></tt>.</p>
