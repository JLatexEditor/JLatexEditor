<h2>Downloading the Complete Help Files</h2>


<p>If you find Hypertext Help with LaTeX to be useful, you are

    welcome to obtain the complete set of files and install them on

    your own machine. Retrieval and installation instructions are

    given below. They may be installed for use either with a

    webserver, which will ease network traffic and probably give you

    faster access, or they may be installed as local files which may

    be "read" by your browser without the necessity of a network

    connection.</p>


<p>To facilitate off-network usage, the files generally have

    only local (within the same directory) hypertext links. All

    links to "external" URLs, including much LaTeX information

    available on the Web, have been restricted to two pages.</p>


<p>If you make these files available on a public webserver,

    please send a note to

    <a href="mailto:webmaster@giss.nasa.gov">webmaster@giss.nasa.gov</a>

    if you would like it to be included among the

    <a href="mirror.html">mirror sites</a>.</p>


<hr size="1" width="50%">


<p>The files are available via anonymous ftp as a

    <a href="ftp://ftp.giss.nasa.gov/pub/sgreen/latex/latex.tar.gz">gzipped

        tar-red archive</a> (about 80 kb). Your web browser can download

    the archive, after which you can use any one of many shareware

    (un)compression programs to extract all the files within. We've

    found recent versions of

    <a href="http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/">StuffIt Expander</a>

    useful in this regard.

    (Note: Some web browsers will automatically uncompress the

    archive after retrieval, but you might still need to extract

    the files from the archive.)</p>


<p>Alternatively, for those of you logged into a Unix (or Linux or

    Mac OS X) shell account, you can retrieve the archive by anonymous

    ftp to <kbd>ftp.giss.nasa.gov</kbd>. Login as user

    <kbd>anonymous</kbd> and give

    your e-mail address as the password, then switch to binary mode,

    and download the file. Following is an example download session:</p>



<pre>

    > <b>ftp ftp.giss.nasa.gov</b>

    Connected to ftp.giss.nasa.gov.

    Name (ftp.giss.nasa.gov:foo): <b>anonymous</b>

<p>After downloading the file on your local machine, issue the

    shell commands:</p>



<pre>

    gunzip latex.tar.gz

    tar -xf latex.tar

</pre>


<p>This will create a subdirectory named <kbd>latex</kbd> in

    your current directory. This new directory contains the complete

    set of HTML files and requires about 1 MByte of disk space.</p>


<p>You may rename or move the entire <kbd>latex</kbd> subdirectory

    as desired; all file references are local to the directory so links

    should continue to work. The "Introduction" file is
