<h2>\centering</h2>



<p>This <a href="declarations.html">declaration</a> corresponds

to the center environment. This declaration can be used inside

an environment such as quote or in a parbox. The text of a

figure or table can be centered on the page by putting a

<tt>\centering</tt> command at the beginning of the figure or table

environment.</p>



<p>Unlike the <a href="ltx-29.html">center environment</a>, the

<tt>\centering</tt> command does not start a new paragraph; it

simply changes how LaTeX formats paragraph units.  To affect a

paragraph unit's format, the scope of the declaration must

contain the blank line or <tt>\end</tt> command (of an

environment like quote) that ends the paragraph unit.</p>



<p><i>Editor's note: although not listed as

<a href="fragile.html">fragile</a> in Lamport, I have found it

necessary to use a <tt>\protect</tt> when putting a

<tt>\centering</tt> command in a <a href="ltx-3.html">sectioning

command</a>. For example,</i></p>



<pre>

    \section{\protect \centering Centered section heading}

</pre>



<hr noshade="noshade" size="1">
