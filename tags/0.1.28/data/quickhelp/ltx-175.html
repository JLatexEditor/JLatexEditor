<h2>\typein</h2>



<p><tt>\typein[cmd]{msg}</tt></p>



<p> Prints <tt>msg</tt> on the terminal and causes LaTeX to stop

and wait for you to type a line of input, ending with return. If

the <tt>cmd</tt> argument is missing, the typed input is

processed as if it had been included in the input file in place

of the <tt>\typein</tt> command. If the <tt>cmd</tt> argument is

present, it must be a command name. This command name is then

defined or redefined to be the typed input.</p>
