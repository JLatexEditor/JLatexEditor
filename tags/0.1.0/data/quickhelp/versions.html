<h2>LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX2e</h2>

<p>The following information is excerpted from "A Document
Preparation System: LaTeX" by Leslie Lamport, 2nd edition and/or
"LaTeX2e for authors", by the LaTeX3 Project Team, June 1994.</p>

<p>LaTex2e was produced in an attempt to reconcile the various,
sometimes incompatble, "flavors" of LaTeX which were developing.
Some of these included the New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS),
SLITeX (for slides), AASTeX (the American Astronomical Society
macros), etc. The major change to LaTeX2e is the method for
trying to make the use of add-on packages more uniform by the
introduction of "classes" and "packages." Most of the new
commands are the "initial" commands, i.e., those which can
appear only <em>before</em> the <tt>\documentclass</tt>
command.</p>

<p>A few standard LaTeX commands have been modified and a few
new commands added, notably:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt><a href="ltx-18.html">\newcommand</a></tt> (and related)
    commands, which now allow for an optional argument in newly
    defined commands</li>
  <li><tt><a href="ensuremath.html">\ensuremath</a></tt></li>
</ul>


<h3>Document Styles and Style Options</h3>

<p>In LaTeX2e, documents begin with a <tt>\documentclass</tt>
command. This replaces the LaTeX 2.09 
<tt><a href="ltx-22.html">\documentstyle</a></tt> command. The
<tt>\usepackage</tt> command has been added and is used in
conjunction with <tt>\documentclass</tt>.</p>

<p>aTeX2e still understands the old 
<tt><a href="ltx-22.html">\documentstyle</a></tt> command; if it
is encountered, LaTex2e enters <em>compatibility mode</em> in
which most 2.09 input files should still be processed properly.</p>


<h3>Type Styles and Sizes</h3>

<p>LaTeX 2.09 commands for changing type style, for example,
<tt>\tt</tt>, still work similarly in LaTeX2e.  The major
difference is that <tt>\sc</tt> and <tt>\sl</tt> can no longer
be used in math mode (except when LaTeX2e is in
<em>compatibility mode</em>, see above).</p>

<p>However, <a href="fonts2e.html">a new set of commands</a>
have been added to allow separate (and independent)
specification of</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shape</li>
  <li>Series</li>
  <li>Family</li>
</ul>

<p>These can be combined to form a wide variety of type styles. If a style
you specify is not available on your computer, LaTeX2e produce a warning
message and will substitute a style it thinks is similar.</p>
