<h2>\line</h2>



<p><tt>\line(x-slope,y-slope){length}</tt></p>



<p>The <tt>\line</tt> command draws a line of the specified

length and slope.</p>



<p>The slope is determined by <tt>(x-slope,y-slope)</tt> which

are signed integers of magnitude less than or equal to 6 and

which have no common divisor except for plus or minus one; For

example (1,0) is a horizontal line; (1,1) gives a slope of 45

degress; (0,1) is a vertical line; (-1,1) is 135 degrees.



<p>The <strong>horizontal</strong> extent of the line is given

by the <tt>length</tt> parameter, except in the case of a

vertical line in which case <tt>length</tt> specifies the

vertical height.</p>
