<p><tt>\include{file}</tt></p>



<p>The <tt>\include</tt> command is used in conjunction with the

<tt><a href="ltx-246.html">\includeonly</a></tt> command for

selective inclusion of files. The <tt>file</tt> argument is the

first name of a file, denoting <tt>file.tex</tt>. If the file is

also in the file list of the <tt>\includeonly</tt> command or if

there is no <tt>\includeonly</tt> command, the <tt>\include</tt>

command is equivalent to</p>



<pre>

    <a href="ltx-213.html">\clearpage</a> \input{file} <a href="ltx-213.html">\clearpage</a>

</pre>



<p>except that if the file <tt>file.tex</tt> does not exist,

then a warning message rather than an error is produced. If the

file is not in the file list, the <tt>\include</tt> command is

equivalent to <tt>\clearpage</tt>.</p>



<p>The <tt>\include</tt> command may not appear in the preamble

or in a file read by another <tt>\include</tt> command.</p>
