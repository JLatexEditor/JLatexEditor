 \begin{verbatim}

 \end{verbatim}

<p>The <tt>verbatim</tt> environment is a paragraph-making

environment that gets LaTeX to print exactly what you type in. 

It turns LaTeX into a typewriter with carriage returns and

blanks having the same effect that they would on a typewriter.

The output looks exactly as it looks in the input file.</p>



<p>The difference between <tt>verbatim</tt> and

<tt>verbatim*</tt> is that the latter prints spaces as "visual"

spaces, i.e., a short, squat "u".</p>



<p>The only text which cannot be placed in the <tt>verbatim</tt>

environment is the 14-character sequence "\end{verbatim}".</p>



<p>The <tt>verbatim</tt> environment may <strong>not</strong> be

used in the argument of another command. However, it

<strong>can</strong> be placed inside a

<a href="ltx-267.html">minipage environment</a> which allows you

to manipulate it's placement.</p>
