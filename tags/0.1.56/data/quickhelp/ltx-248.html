<h2>\input</h2>


<p><tt>\input{file}</tt></p>


<p>The <tt>\input</tt> command causes the indicated

    <tt>file</tt> to be read and processed, exactly as if its

    contents had been inserted in the current file at that point.

    The file name may be a complete file name with extension or

    just a first name, in which case the file <tt>file.tex</tt> is

    used.</p>
